### Patch Changes

- 0042f48: Correct the deploy-adapter usage docs and clean up the published comment surface.

  - **`flyAdapter()` and `railwayAdapter()` documented an API that does not
    exist.** Both JSDoc examples showed
    `defineConfig({ build: { adapter: flyAdapter(...) } })`, but `CelsianConfig`
    has no `build` key and nothing reads one, so following the doc produced a
    config object that was silently ignored and no `fly.toml` / `Procfile` was
    ever written. Both now document the path that works: call `buildEnd()` from a
    post-build script, with its real argument shape.
  - Em-dashes are removed from every published source comment and generated file
    header across these packages, so the text in the shipped `.d.ts` files and in
    generated `fly.toml` / `Dockerfile` output is plain ASCII.

  No runtime behaviour changes in any of these packages. They are versioned only
  to keep the release line in lockstep and to give each one an accurate changelog
  entry for what actually changed.

- 0042f48: Stop shipping broken source maps, and fix the `@celsian/cli` package shape.

  **Source maps are no longer published.** Every package ships `files: ["dist"]`
  and deliberately does not ship `src`, but the build emitted `.js.map` and
  `.d.ts.map` files whose `sources` is `["../src/index.ts"]`, a path that is never
  in the tarball. Consumers got a debugger that could not step into anything and a
  "Go to Definition" that landed on a missing file, while the maps carried real
  weight: `@celsian/core`'s tarball drops from 172.5 kB to 113.0 kB (-34.5%) with
  them removed, 30.1 kB of which was `app.js.map` alone. Without a map, tooling
  falls back to the emitted `.js` / `.d.ts`, which is correct rather than broken.
  Shipping `src` instead would have made the maps work at the cost of roughly
  doubling every tarball for a debugging affordance the project has never offered.

  **`@celsian/cli` is declared as the bin-only package it is.** Its `main` and
  `types` pointed at `dist/index.js`, which is the shebang'd CLI entry, so
  `await import("@celsian/cli")` **executed the CLI** and printed the help banner
  as a side effect of importing it. It also declared `"sideEffects": false`, which
  was untrue of that same entry. `main`, `types` and `sideEffects` are removed and
  no `exports` map is added: the package is consumed through its `celsian` binary,
  and importing it now fails cleanly instead of running a program.

  **`celsian` and `create-celsian` declare `publishConfig.access: "public"`**, the
  only two publishable packages that were missing it.

  **`@celsian/adapter-bun` and `@celsian/adapter-deno` widen their `@celsian/core`
  peer range** from the exact current version to `>=0.5.0 <1.0.0`. An exact peer
  pin meant every consumer had to match the adapter's core version to the patch,
  and it also forced the release tooling to treat every minor as a breaking change
  for those two packages. See `.changeset/README.md`.
